# Vue-CLI | Static blog

I was looking at Nuxt to build a new website for myself, but decided to 
strip it right back to bare-bones and make use of the new Vue CLI to try it out.

I'm using the `prerender-spa-plugin` package as recommended in the original 
[Vue SSR docs.](https://ssr.vuejs.org/#ssr-vs-prerendering)

So far it seems to work pretty well with minimal configuration in vue.config.js.

## TODO

For this to be a blog, I want to be able to drop MD files into a directory
and have them generate routes. Stay tuned...
